									<p>Located on Bennet Street, just outside of the official borders of Herndon, and across the street from my neighborhood, Herndon High School boasts a 
										reputation of being one of the most diverse high schools in the highest funded school district in America. Recently renovated thanks to the taxpayers 
										of Herndon, HHS has expanded its facilities, including a much larger library, as well as a new "one-to-one" program,
										providing each student with a laptop to use both at school and at home.	Hernon High has a robust foreign language program, 
										as well as accelerated mathematics, and sports, having produced several D1 collegiate athletes. 
										Herndon High School has had the pleasure of playing at the D-Day 75th Anniversary parade in Paris, 
										with some of its students appearing on national televsion to give a speech next to US President Donald Trump, 
										French President Emmanuel Macron, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May.
									</p>

									<p> The following content on this page chronicle my four years at HHS, and what I've learned.</p>

									<h4>Freshman Year</h4>
									<p>I came to Herndon High School having already taken Honors Algebra I and Honors Geometry, making me two years ahead in mathematics compared
										to my peers. My first year of high school involved reiterating on the topics learned in middle school, such as applying the principles of
										albegra learned in middle school to more advanced equation and functions in Algebra II. I chose to take Programming as an elective course
										in preparation for computer science, and chose German because I was aware of the exchange program we had with a school in Germany, and 
										wanted to make some international friends.

									<h4>Sophomore Year</h4>
									<p>Sophomore year was when I began to take more advanced classes, with one AP course, and the rest Pre-AP. I moved from programming
										in a graphical interface such as Scratch to programming in Java in an IDE. Sophomore year was also the year I began to take part
										in various clubs (listed at the bottom of the page), as well as the year I learned to drive.

									<h4>Junior Year</h4>
									<p>In Junior year, I went all out with the AP courses, having taken 5 AP courses, with two advanced electives. I furthered my programming
										skillset, having taken a second year of Computer Science, and also Advanced Programming, learning how to make more sophisticated methods
										in Java and C#, as well as using the Unity engine. I began to explore advanced topics at the collegiate level, such as calculus,
										history, and chemistry. I began to take on leadership roles as well, having been involved with several extracurricular activities
										for two years at that point in time.

									<h4>Senior Year</h4>
									<p>Senior year, although cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic, was the year I spent most of my time building my resume and applying
										to universities. Because I was so ahead in mathematics, the only math courses I was able to take at school were AP Statistics,
										and a special dual enrollment course in multivariate calculus/linear algebra offered by nearby George Mason University, 
										so I naturally took both courses. I was planning on taking AP Macro/Microeconomics, but because I was taking three advanced courses
										that were only offered in one period, I was not able to; in fact, I couldn't even take Honors Personal Finance.
