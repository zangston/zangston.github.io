									<h2>Who I am; Where I'm from</h2>
									<p>I'm Winston, born and raised in Herndon, Virginia.</p>
									<p>I'm from your average middle class suburban family. I grew up biking and playing video games with my friends, who I met at school. The town was once mid-sized,
										but it's now starting to grow as the DC Metro Silver Line begins to expand out east towards Ashburn.
									</p>
									<p>It's quite hard to describe myself succintly in such a small webpage. Some know me as the new guy at church. 
										Others know me as one of the older members of my fraternity. A select few recognize me as the guy who skates a little too fast to get to class (story of how I broke my collarbone). 
										My teachers described me on my report cards as bright-eyed and always smiling.
										Hopefully what I write will give you a good idea of who I am :)</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Where I've been; What I've learned</h2>
									<p>I went to Herndon High School, taking mostly AP classes, which placed me about a semester ahead of many of my peers when I went to college.
										I went into high school with many of my lifelong friends I had met previously, but also met many other friends in high school too. At high school, I
										began taking my first steps in my professional career, studying subjects such as Computer Science, calculus, linear algebra, German, and of course
										various humanities. At HHS, I was a member and leader of several clubs, such as Mu Alpha Theta Math Honors Society, Chemistry Honors Society, 
										Delta Phi Epsilon German Honors Society, and National Honors Society.
									</p>
									<p>After high school, I ended up attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, not too far away from my hometown.
										I came to UVA through the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, initially declaring a major in Computer Science. After my first semester,
										I decided I wanted more, and also pursued a second major in Economics. I am now also attempting to declare a minor in Astronomy and another minor in Data
										Science. At UVA, I am a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, Kendo club, Trap and Skeet club, Catholic Hoos, and College Republicans.
									</p>
									<p>
										What I realized was most important, however, was that learning takes place outside of the classroom. At this point in my life, I have worked
										for several companies, both as an intern or low level worker, as well as a manager - at each of which I have learned more about productivity,
										management, and teamwork. I have traveled to different hemispheres and learned to apreciate other cultures, seeing how other people do things
										differently and how there's always more out there to learn.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What I do; What I'm working on</h2>
									<p>Just like any other engineer, I love to make things! I also love to have a good time with my friends and fraternity brothers.
										When I'm not coding, you can find me either playing video games or watching movies with my friends, or out in town having a great night with
										my frat bros.
									</p>
									<p>A hobby/skill that I have developed over the years has been recording clips of myself and my friends playing online games together, then turning
										the footage into 15-20 minute long videos. I'm always working on a new video in my free time and when it's all done, we get together and have
										a fun little movie night :)
									</p>
									<p>Another big project I'm working on is this the website your looking at right now (haha). I decided that a resume wasn't enough to fully show off
										my abilities, so I decided to learn how to use Git and brush up on my HTML skills to make this website. Hopefully, by the time you're reading this,
										my website will be a lot more polished and presentable. 
									</p>
									<p>I'm also currently working on building a new desktop computer for me to support my projects, from streaming & editing, to programming & CAD.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What I am; Where I'm going</h2>
									<p>As of the time I am building this website (summer 2022), I am currently in a lot of roles right now. I am still a UVA student. I am also
										Operations Manager of the UVA branch of a student-run moving company called Storage Scholars. During the moving off-season, I am a software
										development intern at Fannie Mae. </p>
									<p>After my current position, my goals include graduating, starting my career in the private sector (tech, finance, fintech, or a combination),
										becoming a Marine Corps Reserve Officer, and going back to school to get an MBA.
