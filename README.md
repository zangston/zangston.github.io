My (work-in-progress) portfolio site for people interested in my background. Hi employers!

View this site at https://zangston.github.io

Status update May 4. 2023: I was pretty dissatisfied with the previous version of my website, so I decided to nuke it and start from scratch. It was getting hard to manage all the HTML files and I also just didn't like how it looked in general. I've left my old website version as a branch on this repo if you want to download it and look at it (I don't know why you would??). 

Anyway, the new version of my website is obviously just a template, with only a few lines of code changed. It's not representative of my abilities as a programmer. If you want to see some actual code I've written, please look at the other repositories in my Github profile.
