									<p>Founded in Charlottesville, Virginia by President Thomas Jefferson, the University of Virginia is one of the most prestigious
										universities in the nation, being ranked as fourth best public university by U.S. News & World Report, and continues to rank
										in the top 30 univeristies, public and private. UVA is also home to many world-class programs, including law, business, sports, and medicine.

									<h4>First Year</h4>
									<p>Having come to UVA with more than a semester's worth of credit from AP exams, I began my college career already taking
										many major-specific courses. It was my first year at UVA where I gained a newfound love for engineering, design, and applied mathematics.
										I learned many foundational techniques, including CAD, FEA, MATLAB, Excel, and Java programming.
										I also joined Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, where I met some of my closest friends at college.
										During the spring of my first year, I had an extra slot in my schedule, so I decided to fill it with an intro microeconomics course.
										After taking intro micro, I realized that economics was a field that I really enjoyed studying, so moving forward I decided to work
										towards picking up a second major in economics.

									<h4>Second Year</h4>
									<p>My second year at UVA was spent diving deeper into the fields of Computer Science and Economics, as well as applied mathematics.
										Just like how I picked up economics as a second major, I decided to take an intro astronomy course to fill in my schedule, and ended
										up enjoying the course so much that I decided to enroll in other astronomy courses in an attempt to minor in it. Additionally, I originally
										thought that it was required of economics majors to take an intro accounting course, but realized that it was only a requirement for
										engineering students taking the School of Engineering's own business minor. I still decided to stay in the course and walked away
										with new skills in accounting and bookkeeping.

									<h4>Third Year</h4>
									<p>Third year, at the time of building this site, is currently ongoing. I expect to learn about computer architecture and operating systems 
										at a much more in-depth level, as well as getting some more experience in programming with x86 Assembly. I also expect to learn more about 
										the Agile workflow that is common in many workplaces. Additionally, I will be studying economics and finance past the introductory level.
